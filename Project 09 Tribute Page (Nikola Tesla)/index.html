          <h2>father of modern electricity</h2>
          <p>
            <b> Nikola Tesla</b> was a brilliant inventor and engineer who
            changed the world with his ideas about electricity. He was born in
            1856 in a small village called Smiljan, in what is now Croatia.
            Tesla is best known for creating the alternating current (AC)
            system, which is used to bring electricity to our homes and cities.
            He also worked on wireless communication, radio, and even dreamed of
            sending electricity through the air. Tesla was very creative and had
            many ideas, but he didnâ€™t become rich or famous in his lifetime.
            Today, people remember him as a genius who made modern electricity
            possible.
